Dear All,

welcome to DM559, Linear and Integer Programming! The course aims at
introducing you to mathematical tools for solving optimization problems
as they arise in many practical applications. You will learn first about
Linear Algebra and then about the branch of Mathematical Optimization,
known as Linear and Integer Programming. We will have equal focus on
theory and practice. For the practical part we will use Python to carry
out calculations and implement models. I hope that you will enjoy the
course and learn a lot!

In the fourth quarter, the course will be joined with DM545.

The main webpage of the course is be:
    http://www.imada.sdu.dk/~marco/DM559/ 
That will be the place where I will post all material relevant for this
course: updated schedule, slides, notes, links, etc. Please, take a look
at the page.

The page is also linked from the left menu in the BlackBoard system. The
BlackBoard system will be used only to:

- post announcements like this one
- post photocopies as reading material
- provide a "Discussion board" where anonymous posting is allowed


The first class of this course will be tomorrow, Tuesday, January 31, at
10:00 in U24. I look forward to seeing you there.

Best regards,
Marco



There you can find the recommended
book for the Linear Algebra part (a PDF version can be found on the
Web).
